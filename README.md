### ClojureScript7
An implementation of the [7GUIs](https://eugenkiss.github.io/7guis/) in ClojureScript and Reagent by Jovan Jester. All components are currently working more or less fully except for the last one, Cells (a future Excel killer), which is still in progress.

I took some liberties with the tasks as specified in the 7GUIs, mainly those where they suggested modal windows since I felt modal dialogs weren't really necessary in a web app context.
